### "Hi there! I am John. After graduating with my master's degree and running my own personal training business for many years, I decided to change careers and delve into front-end web development. It's been great, and I'm learning a lot! I'm excited to build more projects, steadily improving all the time. Currently, I'm working on lots of JavaScript and React. I'm looking to work remotely and collaborate with others in the web development field! Thanks for exploring. I'll be updating this often, so please come back to see my latest projects. To view my work, click on 'Repositories.' Hopefully, you'll notice improvements and progression throughout my projects."  ðŸ‘‹
