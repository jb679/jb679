### Hi there. I am John. After graduating with my master's degree and many years of my own personal training business, I decided to change careers and learn front-end web development. It's been great and I'm learning a lot! I'm excited to build more projects and steady-building all the time. I'm working on lots of javascript and React at the moment. I'm looking to work remote and collaborating with others in the web-dev field! Thanks for looking around. I'll be updating this often so please come back to see my latest projects. To see my work, click on Repositories.  ðŸ‘‹
