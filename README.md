### "Hi there! I'm John. After obtaining my master's degree and running a successful personal training business, I decided to pivot into front-end web development. The transition has been incredibly rewarding, and I'm continuously expanding my skills, particularly in JavaScript and React. Currently, I'm deeply immersed in building various projects, each contributing to my growth as a developer. I'm actively seeking remote opportunities and eager to collaborate with fellow professionals in the field. Thanks for stopping by! I'll be regularly updating my portfolio, so be sure to check back for my latest projects. Feel free to explore my work by clicking on 'Repositories,' and don't hesitate to connect with me on LinkedIn or Email Me. Looking forward to connecting with you! www.johnbaileydesigns.com  ðŸ‘‹
